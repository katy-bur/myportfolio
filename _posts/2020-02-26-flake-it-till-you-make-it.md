Computer Science program started for me back in 2016. I went in local community college and received a Computer Science associates degree. Unfortunately while I was in school there was no help to find jobs and I had a little knowledge how to get in the field. I kept studying and was a straight A student, but still had no knowledge or idea of who I want to be. Then I decided to go for my graduate program in SNHU and after first semester I got a job in IT. This semester will be my last in Computer Science and I will start my journey to Cybersecurity.
